# Bamazon Marketplace

**Bamazon** is a node marketplace for users to buy any amount of items available. There is also functionality for a manager to add, update, and track inventory in the command line. All of the inventory in Bamazon is stored in a database using mySQL. When anything is updated in the terminal the database is updated accordingly.
